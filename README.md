## Python Chatbots 

This is a collection of programs that get user input and respond to the user based on that input.

__coffee_shop.py__
This program is adapted from a (Codecademy)[https://www.codecademy.com] lesson. It runs on the command line. The user is asked a series of free-text and multiple-choice questions, in order to process a coffee order.

Ideas for extensions:
* have milk questions for every type of drink.
* have a function that uses random, maybe something like "Ooops! We're out of that" or "You've won a freebie"
* have a loyalty card - could the app remember multiple visits by the same person?
* change the print statement so that it's more like Starbucks. Maybe have a timer that waits until your coffee is ready - (indicated on screen by " . . . " or "waiting..." - then says "That's a large skinny latte for Chris".
